D. Common Pitfalls

While CMS products make publishing much more feasible and less time-consuming, they can also cause
unforeseen problems. Below is a list of common problems that companies often face a year after
implementing a new content management system (also provided as a worksheet at the end of this
document):

  * Want to wrap text around an image, but the CMS wonʼt allow editing the HTML directly.
  * Need to write and edit in Spanish, but the CMS only supports English.
  * Need the CMS to publish equally well for all standard browsers. (Some publish flawlessly for Internet Explorer, but pages look strange on Apple computers' Safari browser.)
  * Want to be able to use a third-party ad company, but the CMS wonʼt allow that particular JavaScript.
  * Canʼt easily add permanent hyperlinks to the end of stories (such as “share” on Facebook, MySpace, Digg, Reddit).
  * Canʼt easily create a newsletter out of Web site content without using an expensive, third-party provider.
  * Canʼt embed YouTube videos on the site without dramatically changing the CMS.
  * Want to be able to use searchable data windows, such as a widget, but can't.
  * Want to embed audio within the story pages, but the CMS produces a plain grey window with a Quicktime or Windows Media Player file.
  * Want to be able to place coded tags for a complex Web analytics package, but canʼt.
