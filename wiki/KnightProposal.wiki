=Describe your project=
(29 characters remaining)  

In the process of publishing content to the web, one major hurdle continues to be a recurring theme in newsrooms: Overly restrictive Content Management Systems have become a bottleneck in the work-flow by limiting the presentation of digital content. Journalists are dying to get their hands on a CMS that is easy to use, capable of accommodating new story structures, and practical to deploy.

Rather than relying on expensive, proprietary tools that are not fine-tuned for the art of digital storytelling, journalists should be building their own software tools, which can then be released to the public and shared between organizations. But journalists are writers, not programmers. So we aim to create a software solution to give journalists a venue for telling their stories that is simple to learn and use. We plan to: 

 # Create a simple, pre-packaged, auto-install content management system for news organizations that is built specifically for journalists to tell stories online. 
 # Release public source code in order to encourage development participation by the same community of journalists and developers who will be using the system.  
 # Develop a software community whose sole purpose would be to maintain the software and update it regularly to keep it secure and relevant. 

By the end of eight months, we plan to have a fully functioning beta version, and in one year a final product.

=How will your project improve the way news and information are delivered to geographic communities?=

Walk into most newsrooms, and you’ll find and that the reporters, editors and photographers  have little understanding of how their stories or photos end up on the web. The technical maintenance of publication sites is often outsourced to external companies because the complexity of the CMS is so great that it takes specialized staff to run it.

This is especially apparent in small newsrooms serving local communities, which will be our target audience. As newspaper subscriptions decline, so do the organizations that serve local communities. Our goal is to help the thousands of mid-market news organizations that won't survive as their print costs rise and ad revenues decline.

=How is your idea innovative? (new or different from what already exists)=

It's simple, it's flexible, and it's made for journalists, with the input of journalists.

Unlike most systems, ours will be built with multimedia in mind. We will implement the latest technologies for running video, audio and photo slideshows. It will be pre-packaged with a basic player, but allow for modification and branding. We will also include support for streaming services (served by 3rd parties) to live-broadcast events.


=What experience do you or your organization have to successfully develop this project?=
(456 characters remaining)  

Whenever there is a plan to do something highly ambitious with digital tools, there is usually a hole in the team's skill set. Either there is a lack of technical expertise, or the team is too technical and doesn't appreciate the needs of the everyday user. We've assembled a team that is diverse in its backgrounds and contains the  right combination of skills to make this project a reality.

Team leader Milan Andric is technically proficient in just this way. He is a programmer who spent the last three years working for the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.  He also developed a CMS from the ground up. Built purely in PHP, it was a tremendous learning experience as he realized the evolving needs of journalists required consistent re-thinking of what the system is and does. Along the way he discovered a new mechanism for building CMSes -- Django. He later built a CMS in Django to serve the site for the Knight Digital Media Center at UC Berkeley, which sits on top of a complex and multi-tiered data structure. The site has gone through several revisions, all possible thanks to of the flexibility of the framework.


=What unmet need does your proposal answer?=
(2 characters remaining)  

Online newsrooms struggle with publishing systems that are difficult to change. Systems are often built for a pre-defined story format and controlled by parent corporations. Examples of story formats that newsrooms struggle to publish include Flash-based presentations, map mash-ups, custom navigation and templates for special feature presentations, data-backed presentations like chicagocrime.org or everyblock.com. There are really two obstacles to overcome: 1) Rigid and unchangeable data models on the back-end, and 2) Rigid and unchangeable presentation templates. In contrast, Django Newsroom aims to provide a platform that can accommodate any data type, where custom content types and story formats are encouraged, rather than discouraged.


=What tasks/benchmarks need to be accomplished to develop your project and by when will you complete them?=
(12 characters remaining)

The project is currently in early planning phases, which involves defining requirements and starting the outreach process.  During the “requirements phase” of development, our first objective is to research and discuss what the needs of journalists are, and to formulate the requirements for the software. Once that phase is complete, we’ll create a roadmap defining our path to the first milestone release and final goals.  The requirements phase requires discussion and input from all sides: developers, interaction and interface designers, and particularly journalists who are technically inclined, to craft, define and prioritize features. 

Software construction is a multi-disciplinary activity, so we need to encourage professionals from all areas of the ecosystem to participate. CMSes built by engineers in a vacuum is the problem; we intend not to repeat that mistake.  It is important to find people who see value in the project and encourage them to participate in the open source process.  

"Release early, release often" is a tried-and-true open source mantra. When software is made available early, user interest grows, participants come on board, and feedback is gathered sooner rather than later. A positive and continuous feedback loop will be critical to the project's success.

Our first release will include a web-based slideshow and video application.  These applications are in very high demand, and are particularly needed in multimedia journalism.  We hope to have a release for these applications ready in a month.

When we have a release ready, it is important to have a demonstration site, so folks can kick the tires and begin the feedback loop.  The demo site will be running the current/development version of our software.  This provides a place for anyone to test  features without installing anything.

We have already launched an open discussion group for the project, and participants are actively chewing on ideas and approaches for Django Newsroom.  

=What will you have changed by the end of your project?=
(471 characters remaining)  

Journalism will have an open source project available to it, and we may even see the beginnings of consolidation on a platform.  A Django based CMS is one of the most robust and innovative systems currently available.  If adoption for it at the end of this project shows growth then it may also become interesting for larger organizations to take advantage of it and even contribute to it.

Small and mid-sized news organizations will have an alternative to their current CMS, that for the first time ever, actually makes them happy.  Journalists working in the modern digital world will take comfort in knowing that a vibrant open source community of developers and journalists are working to provide a state of the art publishing platform.

We plan to outfit some smaller organizations with the CMS as a testbed to learn how the platform may need to evolve in the future, and to better understand the needs of the industry.

As the iterative development process progresses, we expect to go through many iterations of sample data models, back-end interfaces, and workflow approaches. Because of the anticipated difficulty of getting this right, we don’t expect it to be perfect the first time. 

=How will you measure progress and ultimately success?=
(546 characters remaining)  

Progress will be measured in milestones and release cycles.  We plan to have a regular release cycle in which a new version of the software will be made available every 3 months.  Each release will address a defined set of objectives, and the team will work towards those goals for each release.  Success will be measured by answering these questions (in rough chronological order):


 * How many people join our discussion group?
 * How many messages are sent in our discussion group?
 * How many views does the demo site get?
 * How many views does the project web site get?
 * Are any major publications linking to or talking about us?
 * How many people actually downloaded the software?
 * How many developers have commit access to the software repository?
 * How many organizations are involved in development of our project?
 * How many organizations are using our software in a production environment?
 * What kind of feedback are we getting from deploying organizations? 
 * Are organizations contributing patches and code back to the project?


=Do you see any risk in the development of your project?=
(12 characters remaining)  

One risk is that it’s relatively difficult for an organization to “escape” from a content management system, once a publication decides on a competing product, it could be difficult to win them back (even if our platform is markedly superior). Therefore it is in the best interest of Django Newsroom to get a working platform “into the wild” sooner rather than later.

We want to create the next !WordPress or Drupal – but built on a framework that is modular and innovative. !WordPress is simple and easy to use, but is built for blogs and simple publications - it was never designed for the complex site structures journalism requires. It's amazing how many organizations attempt to use it as a content management system. Drupal is powerful, but has a steep learning curve due to its broad market and is often frustrating to customize for a specific purpose. Django Newsroom needs to develop quickly fill the niche.

Another challenge is to get people involved. Milan Andric is the team leader, and supporting him is a team of diverse candidates. The participants named below have either shown interest in the project or are actively involved in the current Django Newsroom discussion list.

Back-end: Milan Andric (UC Berkeley), Scot Hacker (KDMC), John Tynan (KJZZ.org/KBAQ.org NPR Affiliate); Front-end Interface Experience: Jeremy Rue (Multimedia Training Instructor, UC Berkeley/KDMC); Multimedia Journalists:  Richard Koci Hernandez (formerly San Jose Mercury News, Ford Fellow for UC Berkeley), Stokely Baksh (Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism),  Kara Andrade (Youth Radio in Oakland), Amy Jeffries (Webmaster for Global News Enterprises).

=What is your marketing plan? How will people learn about what you are doing?=
(901 characters remaining)  

Our marketing plan is to perform outreach at major social networks and development hubs to find interested parties to join our open source project.  The list includes:

	* !LinkedIn’s Python, Django and Journalism groups
	* FOSS Professionals on !LinkedIn
	* Facebook’s Python, Django and Journalism groups
	* Django user and developers groups
	* Pinax user and developer groups
	* Chicago, NY, Berkeley and Phoenix local Python and Django user groups
	* Other online Journalism and Digital Media Groups
	* Contact Python developers already working in the Journalism field
	* Encourage community members to blog about the project

This is to engage initial interest. After we develop early iterations of the project, we plan to develop testbeds with various organizations to learn more about the implementation process. This also aid tremendously in the marketability by creating an real-world example of how the project would function. 

Once the first milestone is reached, a press release will be made to the various journalism news outlets and blogs, including:

	* Knight Digital Media Center
	* !MediaShift/PBS.org
	* NPR.org
	* Romensko (Poynter)
	* Jay Rosen’s !PressThink

We imagine adoption might be slow for existing organizations. But, we believe this project could immediately serve as an invaluable asset to incipient markets and news organizations that are forming Web-only operations. In recent years, such organizations like Politico, Pro-Publica, and Global News Enterprises have formed a new presence in the mediascape. This demonstrates that several more will likely emerge in the coming years.

After initial adoption, we hope this CMS will begin to gain traction as a tool to helping journalists tell stories online.
