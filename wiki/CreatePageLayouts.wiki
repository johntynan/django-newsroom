layouts themselves are stored in the database for easier editing, under the *page_layouts* app. Layouts consist of html built using 960gs CSS grid, example:

{{{
<div class="story-container">
    <div class="grid_8">
    <% image_widget height=250 %>
    <% text_widget 2 %>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_4">
    <% image_widget height=200 %>
    <% text_widget 3 %>
    </div>
</div>
}}}


Various inline widgets can be added to the layout itself to reduce visual html. The currents widgets are:
  * text_widget (<% text_widget id %>) uses TextWidget model on page_layouts to allow for different combinations and text formatting.
  * image_widget (<% image_widget height=200 %>) is an inline that can receive both width and height as a parameter. If width is not present, it will use width="100%"

New inlines can be created on page_layout's models.py, to allow for more combinations
